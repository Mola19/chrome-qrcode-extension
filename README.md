A simple Google Chrome extension that creates QR codes in real time.

# Why

Google chrome itself has a QR code generator, why not use that?

Because, 
1. it is ugly (my opinion),
2. slaps its icon in the middle and
3. you can only generate a qr code for your current url, no text or diffferent urls.

# For Developers

It uses Kazuhiko Arases javascript library (http://www.d-project.com/) to
draw the QR codes

Installing (for developers):

    * Clone the repository somehwere.
    * Go to chrome://extensions
    * Make sure the "Developer mode" checkbox is on
    * Click "Load unpacked extension"
