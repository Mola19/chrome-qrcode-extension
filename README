A Google Chrome extension that shows the current URL as a QR code.

Available in Google Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/qr-code/leicjbimaiecjfljbeikdailcmaadlml

I often use this to quickly copy a URL to my smartphone.

It uses Kazuhiko Arases javascript library (http://www.d-project.com/) to
draw the QR codes instead of relying on some third-party web API (like
all of the other extensions I looked at. Wtf?).

Installing (for developers):

    * Clone the repository somehwere.
    * Go to chrome://extensions
    * Make sure the "Developer mode" checkbox is on
    * Click "Load unpacked extension"

Building:

    gem install crxmake
    ./pack.rb
